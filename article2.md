Ethics paper for AI #2  By Jacob Duus
I have already had an instance this term when AI was not accurate. Very simply, I gave Chatgpt some information in the prompt for the about me assignment and website page. While it wasn’t too bad, there were details that I didn’t include in the prompt, and AI filled in those details for me. I literally copied and pasted the about me into Microsoft word, then I manually edited it. I suppose that I could have continued to edit it with AI, but I just felt like manually making those changes. Because I know for a fact that I did the final edits on it. And every work was mine. I used AI in the drafting process. But the final product was thoroughly gone through by me to ensure that it was accurate. 
I have seen plenty of time when I have searched with google on the internet, and Google’s AI Gemini was not accurate at all. Now at this time it seems to be improving. But for the mean time, I will scroll down and see the actually search results. I can use AI to research things. But I will need to prompt it to use credible resources. And also cite the sources with the information it gave. I will also need to verify the information and the pertaining source. 
From a Biblical stand point. Verifying your sources of information is a thing that requires wisdom and discernment. The book of Proverbs says a lot on that subject. Also testing. 1st John chapter 4 verse 1. “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.” Now 1st John is talking about the spiritual realm. But the principle and technique are the exact same in verifying information. The same technique to verify spirits, we can use to verify information. In the bible verse mentioned, you must first know God. Then when you are dealing with spirits, you will know which ones are of god. If the spirits do not align with God when tested, don’t listen to them. The exact same thing can be said about information. You must first know the subject you are presenting, then what information AI comes up with must align with that. Making sure that you are accurate with the information you give is being truthful.
