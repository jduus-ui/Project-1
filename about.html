    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jake Duus</strong>. I am the <strong>Fleet and Grounds Manager</strong> at <strong>Trinity Bible College</strong> in Ellendale, North Dakota. I oversee the vehicles and the landscape that keep the campus running smoothly.</p>

    <p>I’m also a <strong>part-time student</strong> at the college, continuing to grow in knowledge and skill while balancing work, school, and life. Before coming to Trinity, I served in the <strong>military</strong>, where I learned the value of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance—lessons that continue to shape who I am today.</p>

    <p>My life is rooted in a strong <strong>faith in Christ</strong> and guided by a sense of <strong>honor and duty</strong> to both country and community. I believe in giving my best to every task, living by the words: <em>“Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.”</em></p>

    <p>When I’m not working, you’ll likely find me enjoying <strong>cars, motorcycles, the outdoors, traveling with my wife</strong>, or <strong>cooking ribs on the grill</strong>.</p>
